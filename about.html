      <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Balanced Islamic knowledge is among the most essential necessities for every Muslim. It is the light by which hearts are guided and societies are elevated. Through authentic knowledge derived from the Qur’an and Sunnah, nations rise from ignorance to glory, from confusion to clarity, and from darkness to light.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The Qur’an emphasizes the status of people of knowledge:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="italic border-l-4 border-[#094570] pl-4 text-gray-700 mb-4">
        {Allah bears witness that Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice.}  
        <br><span class="text-sm text-gray-600">– Surat Aal-Imran: 18</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Ash-Shawkani (رحمه الله) explained that “those having knowledge” here refers to the scholars of the Qur’an and Sunnah.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="italic border-l-4 border-[#094570] pl-4 text-gray-700 mb-4">
        {And say, ‘My Lord, increase me in knowledge.’}  
        <br><span class="text-sm text-gray-600">– Surat Ta-Ha: 114</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        And in the hadith: <em>“Whoever takes a path upon which to obtain knowledge, Allah makes the path to Paradise easy for him.”</em>  
        <br><span class="text-sm text-gray-600">– Narrated by Muslim</span>
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (رحمه الله) explained that “knowledge” here refers to knowledge of the Shari‘ah — that which guides one to fulfill what is obligatory upon them in belief, worship, and action.
